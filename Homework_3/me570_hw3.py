    Generates one figure with a sphere (with arbitrary parameters) and  nb_points=100 random points that
are colored according to the sign of their distance from the sphere (red for negative, green for
positive). Generates a second figure in the same way (and the same set of points) but flipping the
sign of the radius  r of the sphere. For each sampled point, plot also the result of the output
